##Initialization
        //So that's the flow path to should be 
git init (initialization)
git config user.name "name"
git config user.email "email adress"
git add * (adding all changes in project)
git commit -m "some init msg" (-m mean message in cut)


        //To take away an added file from the stage We would go to use command 
git restore --staged <file>

        //Comeback to the commit what we want and delete changes what you done
git reset <commit id>




##Stashing objects in project

        //check all changes using command
git status


        //add all or specify changes to commit or stash
git add . 
git add <file>


        //Save changes but not comitt

        //stash your currnet changes
git stash 

        //pop your stashed changes
git pop

        //hide your changes
git stash

        //clear your stashed changes
git stash clear


##Branches

        //Create new branch

git branch <name>

        //Choose your current branch to work with it

git checkout <name>

        //Merge your branch with main branch

git merge <name of branch you wanna merge with main>

##Upstream and clone

        //download the version which you wanna use
git clone <ssh url>

        //add the link original version of project
git remote add upstream <ssh url> 

        //remove the link original version of project
git remote remove upstream

**Upstream allows you to pull request to original project and working on it, but not in directly way, 
*you must create a pull request which one must approved by orginal accout owner, thats in short means merge like on your projects
**Hence you must create a new branch to new feature like you do in your own projects to pull request, because its good path to good project structure on github.com

##Pullrequest
**To create your pullrequest, go to your project, click pull request and create new "New Pull Request"
*You can see base repository, main and your head repository and your comparing branch to do pull request
