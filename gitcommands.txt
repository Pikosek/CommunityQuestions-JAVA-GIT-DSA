##Initialization

git init (initialization)
git config user.name "name"
git config user.email "email adress"
git add * (adding all changes in project)
git commit -m "some init msg" (-m mean message in cut)

//So that's the flow path to should be 

//If we wanted to take an added file from the stage We would go to use command 
git restore --staged <file>

##Reset the project to the commit what we wanted
git reset <commit id>


##Stashing objects in project
//First why are going to do some changes in project, like delete file etc.
//After that, we will use command

git status (to check changes)
git add . (to add all changes)

//Hence when we want to save that changes but not comitted, we will use

git stash 

//Use command 'git pop' to pop
//Use command 'git stash' to hide
